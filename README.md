to use this program, simply add your directory's path into the variable at the top of the script

uses:
- viewing files in a clean and organized text-based display instead of a user interface
- sorting files by size


life is short, have fun while able to do so :)

* I'll add more documentation for the photo mover later

* photo mover v2: script that can be easily configured to run on startup, it will check the
* documents, desktop, and downloads folders and move image files to the default 'Pictures' directory.
* I built it with pyinstaller and then added to my PC's startup folder, so it runs every time i turn my pc on.
* this script will create a folder inside the 'documents' folder called 'python-script-logs' and it will
* generate a log file that captures all files processed along with the timestamps.
* enjoy! :)
