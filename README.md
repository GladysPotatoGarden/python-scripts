Organize and Manage Files Automatically with Simple, Efficient Scripts

Overview

Directory Explorer and Photo Mover v2 are two Python scripts designed to help you manage your files quickly and automatically:

    Directory Explorer: A minimalistic script for viewing files in a clean, text-based format and sorting them by size.
    Photo Mover v2: An automation script that organizes image files by moving them from common directories (e.g., Desktop, Documents, Downloads) to the default Pictures folder at every startup, while keeping a log of each action.

Directory Explorer
Features

    Text-Based Display: View files in a straightforward, organized display within your terminal, removing the need for a complex user interface.
    Sorting by File Size: Sorts files by size for easy comparison and navigation.

Usage

    Configure Directory Path: Add the desired directory path to the variable at the top of the script.
    Run the Script: Execute the script to view files and their sizes in a simple, organized output.

Photo Mover v2
Features

    Automatic Image Organization: Scans Desktop, Documents, and Downloads folders at startup, moving all image files to the Pictures directory.
    Auto-Generated Log: Creates a log file in a folder called python-script-logs within Documents, recording each file moved with timestamps for reference.

Setup Instructions

    Edit Directory Paths (Optional): You can adjust the folder paths in the script to customize which directories are scanned.
    Build with PyInstaller: Create an executable with:

    bash

    python -m pip install pyinstaller
    pyinstaller --onefile photo-mover-v2.py

    Add to Startup: Place the executable (or a shortcut) in the systemâ€™s startup folder so it runs every time the computer boots.
        On Windows, open the Startup folder by pressing Win + R and typing shell:startup. Place the shortcut to your executable here.

Future Enhancements

Documentation will soon include additional configuration options and usage examples.
